# API Key Configuration

Configure your FastNEAR API key to enable authenticated requests with higher rate limits and additional features.

<ApiKeyManager />

## How it works

1. **Set your API key** - Enter your FastNEAR API key in the field above and click "Save API Key"
2. **Automatic inclusion** - Your API key will be automatically included in all RPC documentation examples
3. **Secure storage** - The key is stored locally in your browser's localStorage
4. **Privacy** - Your API key never leaves your browser and is only sent to FastNEAR endpoints

## Getting an API Key

To get a FastNEAR API key:

1. Visit [FastNEAR Subscriptions](https://fastnear.com/#pricing)
2. Choose a subscription plan that fits your needs
3. Create an account and generate your API key
4. Copy the key and paste it in the field above

## Using the API Key

Once configured, your API key will be automatically appended to all RPC requests as a query parameter:

```bash
https://rpc.mainnet.fastnear.com?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

This approach ensures compatibility with various HTTP clients and frameworks while maintaining security.
