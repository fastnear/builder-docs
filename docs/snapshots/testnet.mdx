# Testnet

## RPC Testnet Snapshot

This is likely the preferred approach for syncing, as opposed to downloading an archival snapshot, which is significantly larger and more special-purpose.

Before running the snapshot download script, you can set the following environment variables:

- `CHAIN_ID` to either `mainnet` or `testnet`. (default: `mainnet`)
- `THREADS` to the number of threads you want to use for downloading. Use `128` for 10Gbps, and `16` for 1Gbps (default: `128`).
- `TPSLIMIT` to the maximum number of HTTP new actions per second. (default: `4096`)
- `BWLIMIT` to the maximum bandwidth to use for download in case you want to limit it. (default: `10G`)
- `DATA_PATH` to the path where you want to download the snapshot (default: `~/.near/data`)
- `BLOCK` to the block height of the snapshot you want to download. If not set, it will download the latest snapshot.

**Run this command to download the RPC Testnet snapshot:**

:::info
We will set the following environment variables:
- `DATA_PATH=~/.near/data` - the standard nearcore path
- `CHAIN_ID=testnet` - to explicitly specify the testnet data
:::

`RPC Testnet Snapshot » ~/.near/data`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastnear/static/refs/heads/main/down_rclone.sh | DATA_PATH=~/.near/data CHAIN_ID=testnet bash
```

## Archival Testnet snapshot

:::warning
**Time and storage intensive.**

Be prepared for a large download and the inherent time constraints involved.
:::

Before running the download script, you can set the following environment variables:

- `CHAIN_ID` to either `mainnet` or `testnet`. (default: `mainnet`)
- `THREADS` to the number of threads you want to use for downloading. Use `128` for 10Gbps, and `16` for 1Gbps (default: `128`).
- `TPSLIMIT` to the maximum number of HTTP new actions per second. (default: `4096`)
- `DATA_TYPE` to either `hot-data` or `cold-data` (default: `cold-data`)
- `BWLIMIT` to the maximum bandwidth to use for download in case you want to limit it. (default: `10G`)
- `DATA_PATH` to the path where you want to download the snapshot (default: `/mnt/nvme/data/$DATA_TYPE`)
- `BLOCK` to the block height of the snapshot you want to download. If not set, it will download the latest snapshot.

By default the script assumes the paths for the data:
- Hot data (has to be on NVME): `/mnt/nvme/data/hot-data`

**Run the following commands to download the Archival Testnet snapshot:**

1. Download the latest snapshot block height:

`Latest archival testnet snapshot block`:

```bash
LATEST=$(curl -s "https://snapshot.neardata.xyz/testnet/archival/latest.txt")
echo "Latest snapshot block: $LATEST"
```

2. Download the HOT data from the snapshot. It has to be placed on NVME.

:::info
We will set the following environment variables:
- `DATA_TYPE=hot-data` - downloads the Hot data
- `DATA_PATH=~/.near/data` - the standard nearcore path
- `CHAIN_ID=testnet` - set to testnet network
- `BLOCK=$LATEST` - specify the snapshot block
:::

`Archival Testnet Snapshot (hot-data) » ~/.near/data`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastnear/static/refs/heads/main/down_rclone_archival.sh | DATA_TYPE=hot-data DATA_PATH=~/.near/data CHAIN_ID=testnet BLOCK=$LATEST bash
```
