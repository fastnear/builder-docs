# Builder Documentation

This is a targeted documentation site, potentially for seasoned NEAR devs. There are fantastic resources at [Near.org docs](https://docs.near.org) that may be better to start with.

NEAR Protocol has an advanced feature set, and these docs aim to be clinical and precise in definitions.

Once the fundamentals are understood clearly, it will benefit the builders/founders to see the holistic picture, and remove ambiguity.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
